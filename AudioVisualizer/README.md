### Audio Visualizer in Python
This script runs best in Terminal/CMD, use `python audio_visual.py`

#### Requirements:
- Sounddevice module `pip install sounddevice`
- Numpy library `pip install numpy`

#### Todo:
- Make it work with audio streamed from url links (youtube, bandcamp)
- Keep mic on throughout instead of rapid switching
